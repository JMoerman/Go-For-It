### Storage and Synchronisation

To-do lists are stored in the [Todo.txt](http://todotxt.com/) format. This simplifies synchronization with mobile devices and makes it possible to edit tasks using other Todo.txt front-ends (e.g. the official apps for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.todotxt.todotxttouch&hl=en) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/todo.txt-touch/id491342186?ls=1&mt=8) or the alternative Android client [Simpletask](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.mpcjanssen.todotxtholo&hl=en)).
A comprehensive tutorial about setting up *Go For It!* with *Simpletask* can be found [here](http://itsfoss.com/go-for-it-to-do-app-in-linux/).

If you already use Todo.txt, **beware** of the fact, that *Go For It!* automatically archives completed tasks to the done list!

### Download and Installation

#### GNU/Linux Packages

##### elementary OS

[![Get it on AppCenter](https://appcenter.elementary.io/badge.svg)](https://appcenter.elementary.io/com.github.jmoerman.go-for-it)

##### Ubuntu

I maintain a [Launchpad PPA](https://launchpad.net/~go-for-it-team/+archive/ubuntu/go-for-it-stable) which can be used to acquire .deb packages. On Ubuntu (+ derivates) it is recommended to add the PPA for automatic updates:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:go-for-it-team/go-for-it-stable && sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install go-for-it

For git versions use https://code.launchpad.net/~go-for-it-team/+archive/ubuntu/go-for-it-daily instead.

##### Arch Linux

- [Arch Linux (Stable)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/go-for-it/)
- [Arch Linux (Git)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/go-for-it-git/)

Build it with `makepkg` or use your favorite [aur helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_helpers).

##### Flatpak

[Flatpak](https://flatpak.org) packages support multiple distributions and are sandboxed.

Stable releases are hosted on [Flathub](https://flathub.org):

    flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
    flatpak install flathub de.manuel_kehl.go-for-it

#### FreeBSD

_Go For It!_ is avaiable in the [FreeBSD Ports Collection](https://freshports.org/deskutils/go-for-it):

    pkg install go-for-it

#### Windows

Unfortunately, a recent Windows version isn't available. The https://github.com/mank319/Go-For-It/commits/windows-cmake branch may be a good starting point for porting the current version of _Go For It!_ to Windows.

#### Others

It should be fairly straightforward to compile _Go For It!_ on Unix-like platforms as long as Gtk+3, libnotify and cmake are available.
Should you run into any difficulties feel free to add an [issue](https://github.com/JMoerman/Go-For-It/issues).

## Information For Nerds

_Go For It!_ is free and open source software licensed under the GPLv3. It has been written in _Vala_ making heavy use of the _GTK_ framework.

The user interface is inspired by the design philosophy of [elementary OS](http://elementary.io/) and [Gnome](http://www.gnome.org/) applications, striving for elegant simplicity.

### Roadmap

- "to-do list only" mode

### Potential Future Features

    - option to make the timer count up
    - visualization and export of time tracking data
- mechanics for handling more complex projects
